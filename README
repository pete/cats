Here, placed side-by-side for comparison, are GNU's implementation of
cat, Plan 9's implementation, Busybox's implementation, and NetBSD's
implementation, Seventh Edition Unix (1979), and 4.3BSD.

For good measure (and because I suppose I am now committed to collecting
cats) also included are Second Edition Unix (in assembly) and Inferno's
implementation (in Limbo) for good measure.

All cat.c files (renamed by prefixing the name of the source source) are
presented, unaltered and in their entirety.  Note how easy it is to read
and understand plan9-cat.c (it should take less than a couple of minutes
possibly even for coders that don't know C).  Other than that, I think
the files speak for themselves.

Keep in mind while reading that the cat utility's purpose is to
concatenate files.

Lastly, here are the line and character counts, sorted:
