Here, placed side-by-side for comparison, are GNU's implementation of
cat, Plan 9's implementation, Busybox's implementation, and NetBSD's
implementation, Seventh Edition Unix (1979), Tenth Edition Unix (1989),
and 4.3BSD.

For good measure (and because I suppose I am now committed to collecting
cats) also included are Second Edition Unix (in assembly) and Inferno's
implementation (in Limbo).

All cat.c files (renamed by prefixing the name of the source source)
are presented, unaltered and in their entirety.  Note how easy it is to
read and understand plan9-cat.c (it should take less than a couple of
minutes possibly even for coders that don't know C).  Other than that,
I think the files speak for themselves.

Keep in mind while reading that the cat utility's purpose is to
concatenate files.

Lastly, here are the line and character counts, sorted:
